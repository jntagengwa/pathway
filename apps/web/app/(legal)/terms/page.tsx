            You may terminate your subscription at the end of the current billing period by following the
            cancellation process notified to you or agreed in your contract. We may terminate or suspend your
            access to the Service:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>If you materially breach these Terms and do not remedy the breach (where remediable)</li>
            <li>If you fail to pay any fees when due</li>

            Nexsteps (and/or its licensors) owns all intellectual property rights in and to the Service,
            including the underlying software, design, databases, and documentation. Except as expressly set out

            trade marks.
          </p>
          <p>
            You retain all rights in the data and content that your organisation enters into the Service. You
            grant Nexsteps a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to host, use, process and display

            9. Limitation of liability

            Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence,
            for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot lawfully be limited or
            excluded.
          </p>
          <p>Subject to the above, and to the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
              Nexsteps will not be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental or special loss or damage,
              or for loss of profits, revenue, goodwill or anticipated savings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nexsteps will not be responsible for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with
              these Terms, including failure to implement appropriate safeguards, access controls and training for
              your users.

            <li>
              Nexsteps&apos; total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Service and these
              Terms (whether in contract, tort, negligence or otherwise) will be limited to the fees paid or
              payable by your organisation to Nexsteps in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event

          <p>
            Each party agrees to comply with applicable data protection laws, including UK GDPR and the Data
            Protection Act 2018. The roles of Nexsteps and the Customer, and the handling of personal data, are
            further described in our Privacy Policy and any applicable Data Processing Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, for most personal data within the Service, the Customer is the data controller and
            Nexsteps is the data processor, processing personal data on the Customer&apos;s documented
            instructions. Nexsteps may also act as an independent controller for limited purposes associated with
            operating and improving the Service (for example, billing, support, security and analytics).

            matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), are governed by and construed in

          <p>
            The courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction over any such dispute or claim,

            intellectual property or confidential information.
