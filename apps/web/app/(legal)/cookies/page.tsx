            1. What are cookies?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (such as a computer, tablet or smartphone)
            when you visit a website or use an online service. They are widely used to make websites work, to keep
            them secure, and to provide information to site owners about how their service is being used.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this Cookie Policy, &quot;cookies&quot; also includes similar technologies such as local storage and
            pixels where used in a comparable way.
          </p>

            2. How Nexsteps uses cookies
          </h2>
          <p>
            Nexsteps uses cookies and similar technologies on our marketing site and application in order to:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>Help you sign in and stay signed in securely</li>
            <li>Remember your preferences (for example, active site selection)</li>
            <li>Keep the Service secure and prevent misuse</li>
            <li>Understand how the Service is used so we can improve it</li>
            <li>Support secure payments and billing via Stripe</li>
          </LegalList>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            3. Types of cookies we use
          </h2>

          <h3>3.1 Essential cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are strictly necessary for the Service to function and cannot reasonably be disabled.
            They are usually only set in response to actions made by you, such as logging in, navigating between
            pages, or updating settings. Without these cookies, core features of Nexsteps may not work properly.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of essential cookies include:</p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>Session cookies that keep you logged in as you move around the site</li>
            <li>Security cookies used to protect your account and prevent fraud</li>
            <li>Cookies that store your currently active site or organisation context</li>
          </LegalList>

          <h3>3.2 Analytics cookies</h3>
          <p>
            We use privacy-conscious analytics tools (such as PostHog or an equivalent EU/UK-hosted provider) to
            help us understand how the Service is used, for example:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>Which pages are visited and how often</li>
            <li>Which features are used most frequently</li>
            <li>General performance and error information</li>
          </LegalList>
          <p>
            Where possible, we configure analytics to minimise the use of directly identifiable personal data, and
            to focus on aggregated or pseudonymised usage information. We do not use analytics cookies to build
            marketing profiles about individual children, parents or staff.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3 Stripe and payment-related cookies</h3>
          <p>
            When you update billing details or make payments, Stripe (our payment processor) may set its own
            cookies to:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>Help complete secure payment transactions</li>
            <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
            <li>Remember certain payment-related preferences</li>
          </LegalList>
          <p>
            These cookies are controlled by Stripe and are subject to Stripe&apos;s own privacy and cookie
            policies. They are considered essential for processing payments.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            4. No advertising or tracking cookies
          </h2>
          <p>
            Nexsteps does <strong>not</strong> use third-party advertising cookies or ad-tech trackers to deliver
            targeted advertising. We do not sell or share children&apos;s data with advertisers, and we do not use
            social media tracking pixels for advertising purposes on our core application.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            5. How to manage cookies
          </h2>
          <p>
            Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can usually:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>View which cookies are stored on your device</li>
            <li>Delete existing cookies</li>
            <li>Block some or all cookies from being set in future</li>
          </LegalList>
          <p>
            If you choose to block or delete essential cookies, some parts of the Nexsteps Service may not
            function correctly or may become inaccessible (for example, you may not be able to log in or stay
            logged in).
          </p>

            6. Changes to this Cookie Policy
          </h2>

            legal requirements. When we do, we will update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this
