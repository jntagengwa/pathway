            1. Who we are
          </h2>
          <p>
            Nexsteps (&quot;Nexsteps&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) is a UK-based
            software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that helps schools, churches, clubs, charities, and similar
            organisations manage programmes for children, young people, staff, and volunteers. We are committed
            to protecting the privacy and security of personal data in line with the UK General Data Protection
            Regulation (&quot;UK GDPR&quot;) and the Data Protection Act 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nexsteps acts primarily as a <strong>data processor</strong> on behalf of the organisations that
            use our service. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the organisation that has a subscription
            to Nexsteps (for example, a school, church, club or charity) is usually the{" "}
            <strong>data controller</strong> responsible for deciding how and why personal data is processed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:
          </p>
          <ul>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            2. Our role and your organisation&apos;s role
          </h2>
          <p>
            When an organisation (for example, a school, church, club, or charity) uses Nexsteps, that
            organisation is the <strong>data controller</strong> for most of the personal data stored in and
            processed through the platform. Nexsteps acts as a <strong>data processor</strong>, processing
            personal data on the organisation&apos;s documented instructions in accordance with our contract
            and this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that if you are a parent/guardian, child, staff member, volunteer, or other individual
            whose data is entered into Nexsteps by an organisation, you should first contact that organisation
            if you wish to exercise your data protection rights or have questions about how your data is used.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            3. Categories of data we process
          </h2>
          <p>
            The exact data processed in Nexsteps will depend on how each organisation uses the platform. In
            general, the following categories of data may be processed:
          </p>

              with the organisation&apos;s policies
            </li>
            <li>Additional information the organisation chooses to record (for example, allergies)</li>
          </LegalList>

          <h3>Parent and guardian data</h3>

          </LegalList>

          <h3>Uploaded media and documents</h3>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
              Files, photos or other media uploaded by the organisation (for example, lesson resources,
              consent-related documents), usually only where appropriate consent has been obtained by the
              organisation
            </li>
          </LegalList>

          <h3>Billing and subscription data</h3>
          <LegalList>
            <li>Billing contact details and subscription plan information</li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>Invoice and transaction history</li>

            <li>Usage information about how the platform is accessed and used</li>
            <li>
              Diagnostic and analytics information (for example, using a privacy-conscious analytics provider

          </LegalList>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            4. Lawful bases for processing
          </h2>
          <p>
            For processing where Nexsteps is the data processor, the data controller (your organisation) is
            responsible for identifying and documenting the appropriate lawful basis under UK GDPR. Typically,
            the following lawful bases may apply:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
              <strong>Contract</strong> – where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
              between the organisation and Nexsteps, or between the organisation and its staff/volunteers or
              parents/guardians (for example, providing access to the platform and managing attendance).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – where processing is necessary for the organisation&apos;s
              legitimate interests, balanced against the rights and freedoms of the individuals (for example,
              maintaining security logs, internal reporting and planning).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal obligation</strong> – where processing is necessary for the organisation to comply
              with a legal duty (for example, certain safeguarding, child protection or record-keeping
              requirements).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consent</strong> – in some cases, especially for optional communications or use of photos
              and media, the organisation may rely on consent from parents/guardians or staff.
            </li>
          </LegalList>
          <p>
            Nexsteps may also process limited data as an independent controller in order to operate and improve
            our service (for example, account-level contact and billing information, service analytics and
            security logging). In those cases we generally rely on <strong>contract</strong> and/or{" "}
            <strong>legitimate interests</strong> as our lawful bases.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            5. How we use personal data
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use personal data, on behalf of organisations and for our own purposes, to:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
              <strong>Provide and operate the service</strong> – including creating and managing user accounts,
              recording attendance, managing rotas and sessions, and facilitating communication between staff
              and parents/guardians.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Support safeguarding workflows</strong> – allowing authorised staff to record and manage
              appropriate safeguarding and pastoral notes in accordance with their own policies and legal
              obligations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Provide customer support</strong> – responding to support requests, fixing issues and
              helping organisations use Nexsteps effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maintain security and integrity</strong> – including access control, authentication, audit
              logging, monitoring for misuse, and protecting against fraud or unauthorised access.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improve and develop the platform</strong> – analysing usage patterns in an aggregated or
              pseudonymised form to improve performance, features and usability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Handle billing and account management</strong> – managing subscriptions, processing
              payments via Stripe, and sending service-related notices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Comply with legal obligations</strong> – responding to lawful requests from regulators or
              law enforcement where required.
            </li>
          </LegalList>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            6. Data retention
          </h2>
          <p>
            As data processor, Nexsteps retains personal data in line with each organisation&apos;s
            configuration and documented instructions. In general:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
              Organisations control how long children&apos;s records, attendance data and
              safeguarding-related information are retained, subject to their legal obligations and internal
              policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nexsteps provides tools to support data export and deletion on request from the organisation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Following termination of a customer&apos;s subscription, we will work with the organisation to
              export data where required and then delete or irreversibly anonymise personal data from our
              active systems after a defined period, subject to any legal retention obligations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some minimal records (for example, invoices and basic account history) may be retained for a
              longer period where required for accounting, tax or legal purposes.
            </li>
          </LegalList>

            7. Security measures
          </h2>
          <p>
            We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data processed through
            Nexsteps, including:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
              <strong>Role-based access control</strong> – access to data is restricted based on user roles (for
              example, admin, staff, safeguarding roles) and the site (tenant) they belong to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tenant isolation</strong> – data for each customer organisation is logically separated so
              that users can only access data for their own site(s), subject to their permissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secure transmission</strong> – all data in transit between users and our platform is
              encrypted using industry-standard HTTPS/TLS.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secure hosting</strong> – we use reputable cloud infrastructure providers (such as AWS or
              equivalent) in appropriate regions, with hardened configurations and access controls.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Access controls and logging</strong> – administrative access to production systems is
              restricted to authorised personnel and actions are logged for audit purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backups and resilience</strong> – regular backups and resilience measures are in place to
              protect against data loss and service outages.
            </li>
          </LegalList>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-pw-text first:mt-0 text-center">
            8. Subprocessors and third-party services
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use carefully selected subprocessors and third-party services to help deliver the Nexsteps
            platform. These providers may process personal data on our behalf. Key categories include:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
              <strong>Authentication provider</strong> – for example, Auth0, which manages secure authentication
              of users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cloud hosting and storage</strong> – such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or an equivalent
              cloud provider, used to host our application, databases and stored files.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment processor</strong> – Stripe, used to handle subscription billing and payment
              processing on our behalf. Stripe processes payment card data in accordance with PCI-DSS.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Email delivery provider</strong> – such as Resend or Amazon SES, used for sending
              transactional and service-related emails.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analytics provider</strong> – a privacy-conscious analytics platform such as PostHog,
              configured to respect UK/EU data protection requirements and, where possible, minimising the use
              of directly identifiable personal data.
            </li>
          </LegalList>
          <p>
            We maintain appropriate data processing agreements with our subprocessors and take steps to ensure
            they provide suitable safeguards for personal data. A current list of subprocessors is available on
            request from customer organisations.
          </p>

            9. International data transfers
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our primary hosting locations are intended to be within the UK and/or European Economic Area (EEA).
            However, some of our subprocessors may process data in other countries, including outside the UK and
            EEA (for example, where support teams or infrastructure are based overseas).
          </p>
          <p>
            Where personal data is transferred outside the UK/EEA, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are
            in place, such as:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
              An adequacy decision from the UK government or European Commission in respect of the destination
              country; and/or
            </li>
            <li>
              Standard contractual clauses or other appropriate contractual safeguards approved under UK GDPR.
            </li>

            10. Data subject rights
          </h2>
          <p>
            Under UK data protection law, individuals have a number of rights in relation to their personal data,
            including:
          </p>
          <LegalList>
            <li>
