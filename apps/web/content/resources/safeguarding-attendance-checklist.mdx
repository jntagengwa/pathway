## Best Practices

### Timeliness

Capture attendance and safeguarding information as close to the event as possible. This ensures accuracy and helps you spot patterns early.

### Consistency

Use consistent categories and terminology across your records. This makes it easier to search and analyse data later.

### Privacy

Ensure that safeguarding information is only accessible to authorised staff members. Follow your organisation's data protection policies.

### Regular Reviews

Schedule regular reviews of your attendance and safeguarding records. This helps identify trends and ensures nothing is missed.
